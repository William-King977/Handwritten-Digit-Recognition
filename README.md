# About
A small project involving handwritten digit recognition using machine learning. Inspired by scikit-learn's "Recognizing hand-written digits". 
- It can be found here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-digits-classification-py.

# Cuurent State of the Project
- Machine learning models are trained using the MNIST data set (Tensorflow/Keras import).
- They can predict the digit drawn on the canvas, but does so very badly.
- Planning on improving the classifier models (or train a 'better' one) and possibly improve the preprocessing for the images.
