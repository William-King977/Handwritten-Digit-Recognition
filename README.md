# About
A small project involving handwritten digit recognition using machine learning. Inspired by scikit-learn's "Recognizing hand-written digits". 
- It can be found here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-digits-classification-py.

# Main Features
- Machine learning models are trained using self-written images (of digits). The overall idea is to see how different classifiers perform.
- They can predict the digit drawn on the canvas.
- Allows saving of an image if the digit is predicted wrong.
